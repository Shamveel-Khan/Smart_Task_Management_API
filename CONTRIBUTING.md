## 🛠️ Making Changes

### ✅ Code Standards

* Follow **Clean Architecture** principles — the **Domain layer must not reference external libraries**.
* Nullable reference types are enabled project-wide — use them properly.
* Add **XML documentation comments** for all public APIs.
* Use meaningful and descriptive names — avoid abbreviations such as `wrkItm` or `tmp`.
* Keep methods small and focused.

---

### ✅ Commit Message Convention

We follow a lightweight version of **Conventional Commits**:

```
type(scope): short description
```

#### Examples

```
feat(api): add WorkItem filtering by priority
fix(infrastructure): resolve Hangfire connection issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions
test(application): add validation unit tests
```

#### Common Types

* `feat` — new feature
* `fix` — bug fix
* `docs` — documentation
* `refactor` — internal restructuring without behavior change
* `test` — tests
* `chore` — maintenance tasks
